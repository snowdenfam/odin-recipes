  <div class="container">

    <li>Â½ -1 tablespoon hot sauce</li>
    <li>3-4 garlic crushed</li>
    <li>2-3 teaspoons creole seasoning</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="container">
  <h2>Chicken Coating</h2>
  <ul class="myUL"></ul>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt adjust to taste</li>
    <li>2 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>2 tablespoon onion powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon white pepper</li>
    <li>1- 1 1/2 tablespoon dried herbs Thyme, Oregano, Parsley</li>
    <li>4 cups buttermilk</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Place chicken in a large bowl or Large ziploc. 
      Then seasoned with salt followed by all the crushed garlic, 
      hot sauce and creole seasoning.</li>
    <li>Pour buttermilk in the marinated chicken, transfer the chicken to a gallon-sized zipper-lock freezer bag and refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to overnight.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, salt, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, herbs and white pepper.</li>
    <li>Remove all the  marinated chicken from the  buttermilk . Then dredge in flour mixture, shaking any excess flour. You may use a Ziploc bag for this process, too.</li>   
    <li>Double dip the chicken in the remaining buttermilk( add fresh  buttermilk as needed) followed by the flour mixture - shake off any excess flour. Let the  chicken rest  for about 10-15 minutes while preparing oil. This will help the coating to stay on better.</li>
    
    
  
  </ol>
  <h2>Frying the chicken</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or cast iron skillet to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Temperature will drop once you add chicken.</li>
    <li>Using a tong and carefully and slowly place the chicken in the hot oil. Work in batches. Do not overcrowd the skillet. </li>
    <li>Fry the chicken until golden brown, turning once every 10 to 20 minutes - depending on the size of the pieces. Chicken is done when it is no longer pink inside and its juices run clear. You may do a test by piercing the chicken with a fork.</li>
    <li>Drain the chicken on paper towels and then transfer them on a wire rack. (see notes)</li>
    <li>Repeat with remaining chicken pieces; let it cool for at least 10 minutes before serving.</li>
