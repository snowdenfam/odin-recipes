<p>But wait...for those who don't know. 
  <h2><em><center>What is soul food?</center></em></p></h2>
<p>Although the term "soul food" has become shorthand for all African American cooking, 
  it's really only one aspect of it. Yep Soul food is the cuisine of the landlocked areas of the Deep 
  South that millions of African Americans left behind when they moved North, Midwest, and West during "The Great Migration" (1910s to the 1970s). 
  Soul food is an immigrant cuisine that fuses together the culinary traditions of West Africa, Western Europe, and the Americas. 
  Though they share an African heritage, 
  the Creole cuisine of Louisiana and the lowcountry 
  cuisine of the Georgia and South Carolina coastline are something different.
